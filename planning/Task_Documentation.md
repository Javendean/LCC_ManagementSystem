# Task at Hand: Comprehensive Dependency and Vulnerability Analysis

The overall objective is to perform a comprehensive analysis of the project's dependencies, with a focus on the risks associated with updating `eslint-config-prettier` and the vulnerabilities identified by `npm audit`.

The task involves the following steps:

1.  **Initial Analysis:**
    *   Analyze the risks of running `npm install eslint-config-prettier@latest --save-dev`.
    *   Critically review the analysis using `npm` tools.

2.  **Vulnerability Assessment (Stack Overflow):**
    *   Create and execute a plan to use the Stack Overflow app to research the high-risk security vulnerability.
    *   Determine if the vulnerability is a genuine threat or an overreaction.
    *   Document the findings in `stackoverflow_findings.md`.

3.  **Vulnerability Assessment (Linkup):**
    *   Create and execute a plan to use the Linkup tools app to further assess the vulnerability.
    *   Document the findings in `linkup_findings.md`.

4.  **Comprehensive Dependency Analysis:**
    *   Compose an overall dependency analysis in `dependency_analysis.md`, incorporating findings from the chat, Stack Overflow, and Linkup.
    *   Create a "golden source" dependency map in `dependency_map.md`.

5.  **NPM Output Analysis:**
    *   Analyze the output of `npm install` and `npm audit fix`.
    *   Document the analysis in `npm_update_analysis.md`.
    *   Critically review and refine the analysis.

6.  **SvelteKit Issue Resolution:**
    *   Use the `svelte5` MCP server tools to address the SvelteKit issues identified in the `npm audit` report.
    *   Further improve `npm_update_analysis.md` using the `svelte5` tools (`audit_with_rules`, `explain_concept`, `generate_with_context`, `search_examples`, `search_knowledge`).
