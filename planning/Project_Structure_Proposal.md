# Project Structure Proposal: The Workspace Model

This document outlines a proposal for a more robust and flexible project architecture that is easily reversible and ideal for deployment workflows on Vercel.

## Proposed Architecture

Instead of a single monolithic directory, we will adopt a "workspace" model. The root of the project will serve as the workspace, containing both the application code in a dedicated subdirectory and all related documentation and planning files.

### Directory Structure

```
d:\DevProjects\LCC_Mgmt\
├── app\                # <-- All SvelteKit application code
│   ├── src\
│   ├── static\
│   ├── package.json
│   ├── svelte.config.js
│   └── ... (all other app-specific files)
│
├── dependency_analysis.md  # <-- All planning & documentation files
├── GEMINI.md
├── Task_Documentation.md
└── ... (all other .md, .txt, .docx files)
```

### Benefits

1.  **For Development & AI Agents:** The entire project context, including documentation, is available when the root directory is opened. This is ideal for development and for providing maximum context to AI coding agents.
2.  **For Production Deployment:** Vercel's "Root Directory" setting will be configured to point to the `app` directory. This ensures that only the application code is deployed, resulting in a clean and lean production build, ignoring all development and planning files.

### Reversibility

This structure is easily reversible. To revert, you would simply move the contents of the `app` directory back to the root.

## Implementation Plan

1.  **Undo Previous Consolidation:** Move all files from the `my-app` directory back to the project root.
2.  **Create New `app` Directory:** Create a new, empty directory named `app`.
3.  **Move Application Code:** Relocate all application-specific files and folders (e.g., `src`, `static`, `package.json`, `svelte.config.js`) into the new `app` directory.
4.  **Keep Documentation in Root:** All `.md`, `.txt`, and `.docx` files will remain in the root directory, separate from the application code.

This approach provides a clean separation of concerns, improves project organization, and streamlines the deployment process.
