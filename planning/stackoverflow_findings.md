# Stack Overflow Vulnerability Assessment: eslint-config-prettier

## Objective

This document summarizes the findings from a search on Stack Overflow to assess the validity of the security vulnerability identified in the `eslint-config-prettier` npm package and to gauge the developer community's reaction to it.

## Search Queries

The following search queries were used on Stack Overflow:

- `eslint-config-prettier vulnerability`
- `eslint-config-prettier malicious`
- `eslint-config-prettier security`

## Findings

**No relevant results were found on Stack Overflow for any of the search queries.**

## Analysis

The absence of discussion on Stack Overflow regarding this specific vulnerability suggests that it is not a topic that has been addressed in the Q&A format of the platform. This is not entirely surprising, as Stack Overflow is primarily for specific coding questions and answers, while security vulnerability discussions often take place on other platforms such as:

- GitHub Issues for the affected repository
- Security blogs and news sites (e.g., Snyk, BleepingComputer)
- Social media platforms like Twitter and Reddit

Therefore, I am unable to use Stack Overflow to determine whether my assessment of the vulnerability as "high risk" is an overreaction based on community feedback from that platform.

## Conclusion

My assessment of the vulnerability's severity remains based on the official vulnerability reports, which describe it as involving "malicious code". The lack of discussion on Stack Overflow does not diminish the severity of the vulnerability itself. It is crucial to rely on the official CVEs and security advisories for risk assessment.
