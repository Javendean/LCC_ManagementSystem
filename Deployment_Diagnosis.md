# Vercel Deployment Diagnosis

This document outlines the diagnosis of the Vercel deployment failure for the `lcc-management-system` project.

## 1. Initial State

-   **Symptom:** The deployment URL returns a 404 Not Found error.
-   **Deployment Log:** The deployment logs show that the build process is failing.

## 2. Root Cause Analysis

Analysis of the build logs revealed multiple issues:

### 2.1. Missing Dependencies and Incorrect Imports

The build was failing due to unresolved imports for `@tanstack/svelte-table` in multiple files. The project was using `tanstack-table-8-svelte-5` but the import paths were not updated.

### 2.2. Invalid `jsconfig.json`

A warning was also present in the logs regarding an invalid `extends` property in `jsconfig.json`.

### 2.3. Svelte 5 Runes Compliance

The `svelte-autofixer` tool identified that the `DataTable.svelte` component was not compliant with Svelte 5's runes mode.

## 3. Resolution

The following steps were taken to resolve these issues:

1.  **Added Missing Dependencies:** The `package.json` file was updated to include all necessary dependencies.
2.  **Corrected Imports:** The import statements in `app/src/lib/components/contacts-data-table/DataTable.svelte` and `app/src/lib/components/contacts-data-table/columns.js` were updated to use `tanstack-table-8-svelte-5`.
3.  **Corrected `jsconfig.json`:** The `extends` property in `jsconfig.json` was updated.
4.  **Made `DataTable.svelte` Svelte 5 Compliant:** The component was updated to use the `$props()` rune and keyed `{#each}` blocks.

## 4. Next Steps

With these fixes in place, the project is now ready for a new deployment attempt. The expectation is that the build will now complete successfully and the 404 error will be resolved.
