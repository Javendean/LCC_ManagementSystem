# Vercel Deployment Diagnosis

This document outlines the diagnosis of the Vercel deployment failure for the `lcc-management-system` project.

## 1. Initial State

-   **Symptom:** The deployment URL returns a 404 Not Found error.
-   **Deployment Log:** The deployment logs show that the build process is failing.

## 2. Root Cause Analysis

Analysis of the build logs revealed multiple issues:

### 2.1. Missing Dependencies

The build was failing due to unresolved imports for the following packages:
-   `@tanstack/svelte-table`
-   `lucide-svelte`

These packages were used in the `DataTable.svelte` component but were not declared as dependencies in the `package.json` file.

### 2.2. Invalid `jsconfig.json`

A warning was also present in the logs regarding an invalid `extends` property in `jsconfig.json`.

### 2.3. Svelte 5 Runes Compliance

The `svelte-autofixer` tool identified that the `DataTable.svelte` component was not compliant with Svelte 5's runes mode. Specifically, it was using `export let` instead of the `$props()` rune and was missing keys in the `{#each}` blocks.

## 3. Resolution

The following steps were taken to resolve these issues:

1.  **Added Missing Dependencies:** The `package.json` file was updated to include `tanstack-table-8-svelte-5` (a Svelte 5 compatible version of the table library) and `lucide-svelte`.

2.  **Corrected `jsconfig.json`:** The `extends` property in `jsconfig.json` was updated to point to the correct path.

3.  **Made `DataTable.svelte` Svelte 5 Compliant:**
    *   The import statement in `app/src/lib/components/contacts-data-table/DataTable.svelte` was changed to `tanstack-table-8-svelte-5`.
    *   The `export let` was replaced with the `$props()` rune.
    *   Unique keys were added to all `{#each}` blocks.

## 4. Next Steps

With these fixes in place, the project is now ready for a new deployment attempt. The expectation is that the build will now complete successfully and the 404 error will be resolved.
