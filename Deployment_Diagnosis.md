# Vercel Deployment Diagnosis

This document outlines the diagnosis of the Vercel deployment failure for the `lcc-management-system` project.

## 1. Initial State

-   **Symptom:** The deployment URL returns a 404 Not Found error.
-   **Deployment Log:** The deployment logs show that the build process is failing.

## 2. Root Cause Analysis

Analysis of the build logs revealed two primary issues:

### 2.1. Missing Dependency and Incorrect Import

The most critical error was a build failure caused by an unresolved import:

```
[vite]: Rollup failed to resolve import "@tanstack/svelte-table" from "/vercel/path1/src/lib/components/contacts-data-table/DataTable.svelte".
```

This indicates that the `DataTable.svelte` component was trying to import from `@tanstack/svelte-table`, but the package installed was `tanstack-table-8-svelte-5`. The import statement in the component was incorrect.

### 2.2. Invalid `jsconfig.json`

A warning was also present in the logs:

```
â–² [WARNING] Cannot find base config file "./.svelte-kit/tsconfig.json" [tsconfig.json]
```

This was caused by an `extends` property in `jsconfig.json` that pointed to a non-existent file. This has been corrected.

## 3. Resolution

The following steps were taken to resolve these issues:

1.  **Corrected Import:** The import statement in `app/src/lib/components/contacts-data-table/DataTable.svelte` was changed from `@tanstack/svelte-table` to `tanstack-table-8-svelte-5`.

2.  **Corrected `jsconfig.json`:** The invalid `extends` property was removed from the `jsconfig.json` file.

## 4. Next Steps

With these fixes in place, the project is now ready for a new deployment attempt. The expectation is that the build will now complete successfully and the 404 error will be resolved.
