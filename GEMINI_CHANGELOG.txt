# Gemini Agent Changelog - LCC_Mgmt Project

This document summarizes the debugging process and final changes made to the application.

---

### Initial State & Problem Analysis

*   **Initial Problem:** User was unable to log in, receiving a `400 Bad Request` from Supabase. This was diagnosed as using the database's encrypted password hash instead of the plain-text password.
*   **Second Problem:** The password recovery flow was broken. Clicking a reset link resulted in a blank page with an `otp_expired` error in the URL, indicating the client-side application was not handling the Supabase `PASSWORD_RECOVERY` event.
*   **Core Issue Discovery:** A lengthy debugging process revealed the root cause: a nested project structure. The active project was `my-app/`, but initial edits were incorrectly applied to the parent directory. Furthermore, the dev server was running on port `3000` while the Supabase config and user were pointing to `5173`.

---

### Final Implemented Solution (Applied to `my-app/`)

The following changes were made within the `d:\DevProjects\LCC_Mgmt\my-app\` directory to create a full, working authentication system.

**1. Vite Configuration (`my-app/vite.config.js`)**

*   **Change:** Explicitly set the development server port to `5173` to ensure consistency with the Supabase configuration and avoid confusion.
*   **Code:**
    ```javascript
    export default defineConfig({
        plugins: [sveltekit()],
        server: {
            port: 5173
        }
    });
    ```

**2. Server-Side Route Protection (`my-app/src/hooks.server.js`)**

*   **Change:** Implemented robust route protection. It allows unauthenticated users to access a specific list of public pages while redirecting all other requests to the login page.
*   **Logic:**
    -   An `unauthenticatedPaths` array (`['/','/login','/signup','/auth/callback','/auth/update-password']`) defines all publicly accessible routes.
    -   If a user has no session and is not on an allowed path, they are redirected to `/login`.
    -   If a user *has* a session and tries to visit `/login` or `/signup`, they are redirected to the main `/contacts` page.

**3. Client-Side Event Handling (`my-app/src/routes/+layout.svelte`)**

*   **Change:** Added a Supabase `onAuthStateChange` listener to handle authentication events on the client-side.
*   **Logic:**
    -   The listener is set up inside the `onMount` lifecycle function.
    -   It specifically listens for the `PASSWORD_RECOVERY` event. When detected, it redirects the user to the `/auth/update-password` page using `goto()`.

**4. Password Update Page (`my-app/src/routes/auth/update-password/+page.svelte`)**

*   **Change:** Created a new page to allow users to securely set their new password.
*   **Logic:**
    -   The page contains a form with "New Password" and "Confirm New Password" fields.
    -   On submission, it calls `supabase.auth.updateUser()` with the new password.

**5. Sign-Up Page (`my-app/src/routes/signup/+page.svelte`)**

*   **Change:** Created a new page for user registration.
*   **Logic:**
    -   The form collects an email and password and calls `supabase.auth.signUp()`.
    -   Upon success, it displays a message prompting the user to check their email for a verification link.

**6. Login Page Update (`my-app/src/routes/login/+page.svelte`)**

*   **Change:** Added a link below the login form to direct new users to the `/signup` page, completing the user flow.

### Debugging Session - 2025-09-04

*   **Problem:** User reported errors after signing up a new user. The Vite server log revealed build failures, not a runtime sign-up error.
*   **Analysis:** The build failed for two reasons:
    1.  The `@tanstack/svelte-table` package was missing.
    2.  A `Skeleton` component was being imported from `$lib/components/ui/skeleton`, but the component and its UI library were not present in the project.
*   **Actions Taken:**
    *   Installed the `@tanstack/svelte-table` dependency into the `my-app` workspace using the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag to resolve dependency conflicts.
    *   Removed the import and usage of the non-existent `Skeleton` component from `my-app/src/routes/contacts/+page.svelte` to allow the page to build.
*   **Secondary Issue:** A security warning from the Supabase library was identified. An attempt was made to refactor `my-app/src/hooks.server.js` and `my-app/src/routes/+layout.server.js` to use the secure `supabase.auth.getUser()` method.
*   **Outcome:** The user reported the security refactor was not successful and has opted to focus on a different issue.

### Debugging Session - 2025-09-04 (Continued)

*   **Problem:** After fixing initial build errors, new errors emerged from the `DataTable.svelte` component.
*   **Analysis & Actions:**
    1.  **`lucide-svelte` not found:** The component required the `lucide-svelte` icon library. The installation initially failed with the same `ERESOLVE` conflict as before.
        *   **Fix:** Installed the package using the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag.
    2.  **UI Components not found:** After fixing the icon import, new errors appeared for missing UI components (`Table`, `Input`, `Button`, `DropdownMenu`) from a non-existent `$lib/components/ui` directory. This pointed to a missing `shadcn-svelte` library setup.
        *   **Fix Strategy:** To safely resolve the errors without a complete view of the file, an iterative approach was taken. The broken import statements in `DataTable.svelte` were commented out to isolate the problem from an import issue to a template issue. This is intended to provoke a more specific error to guide the next step.

### Feature - Forgot Password - 2025-09-08

*   **Added a "forgot password" feature to the application.**
*   **Created `src/routes/auth/forgot-password/+page.svelte`:** A new page with a form for users to enter their email address to request a password reset.
*   **Created `src/routes/auth/forgot-password/+page.server.js`:** Server-side logic to handle the password reset request. It calls the `supabase.auth.resetPasswordForEmail()` function to send a password reset link to the user's email.
*   **Updated `src/routes/login/+page.svelte`:** Added a "Forgot Password?" link to the login page to direct users to the new forgot password page.
*   **Verified `src/routes/auth/update-password/+page.svelte`:** Ensured that the existing update password page correctly handles the password reset flow initiated from the email link.

### Project Review - 2025-09-08 (Phase 1: Authentication and Security)

*   **Reviewed Supabase Authentication Settings:**
    *   Fetched the project's authentication configuration and API keys.
    *   **Security Recommendations:**
        *   **Disable Email Auto-confirmation:** The `mailer_autoconfirm` setting is currently enabled, which is a security risk. It is highly recommended to disable this to ensure users verify their email addresses.
        *   **Strengthen Password Policy:** The minimum password length is set to 6 characters. Consider increasing this to 8 or 10 for better security.
        *   **Enable Captcha:** To protect against automated attacks, consider enabling captcha on login and signup forms.
        *   **Require Re-authentication for Password Updates:** For enhanced security, it is recommended to enable the `security_update_password_require_reauthentication` setting.

### Project Review - 2025-09-08 (Phase 2: Database Schema and Data Model)

*   **Reviewed Supabase Database Schema:**
    *   Listed all schemas in the database and found no custom schemas.
    *   Listed all tables in the `public` schema and found no user-created tables. This is a significant finding, as it suggests the application may not have a complete data model yet, or the data is stored in a different way.

---

### Project Review - 2025-09-08 (Phase 3: Serverless Infrastructure)

*   **Reviewed Supabase Edge Functions:**
    *   Listed all Edge Functions in the project and found that no functions have been deployed. This indicates that the project is not currently using Supabase Edge Functions for serverless logic.

---

### Project Review - 2025-09-08 (Phase 4: Operational Health Check)

*   **Reviewed Supabase Logs:**
    *   Attempted to retrieve logs for all services using the available tools.
    *   **Issue:** I was unable to retrieve any logs due to persistent issues with the available tools. The `SUPABASE_GET_LOGS` tool was not found, and direct queries to the log tables failed. This prevents a complete assessment of the project's operational health.
