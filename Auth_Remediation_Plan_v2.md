# Authentication System Remediation Plan (v2)

This document outlines a comprehensive, three-phase plan to address the security vulnerabilities, bugs, and usability issues identified in the `Auth_Review_Findings.md` file. This plan incorporates research for existing solutions and thorough testing to ensure a robust and secure authentication system.

## Phase 1: Research and Discovery

**Objective:** To identify existing, well-maintained libraries and code snippets to accelerate development and improve the quality of the implementation.

**Critique of this Approach:** While using third-party libraries can speed up development, it also introduces external dependencies that need to be vetted for security and maintainability. The selection process must be rigorous.

**Actions:**

1.  **Discover Tools:** Use `RUBE_SEARCH_TOOLS` with the `octocode` toolkit to find relevant tools for searching GitHub.
    *   `RUBE_SEARCH_TOOLS(use_case="search github repositories for sveltekit components")`
2.  **Search for Solutions:** Use the discovered `octocode` tools to search for:
    *   "SvelteKit Supabase auth"
    *   "SvelteKit password strength indicator"
    *   "SvelteKit authentication UI"
3.  **Analyze and Select:** Analyze the search results and select the most promising solutions based on community usage, maintenance activity, and code quality.

**Research Findings:**

*   **SvelteKit Supabase Auth:**
    *   `supabase/auth-helpers` (901 stars): Deprecated. Will not use.
    *   `j4w8n/sveltekit-supabase-ssr` (127 stars): Appears active and relevant. Will review for architectural patterns and code examples.
    *   `engageintellect/sveltekit-supabase` (113 stars): Appears active and relevant. Will review for architectural patterns and code examples.
*   **SvelteKit Password Strength Indicator:** No direct, widely adopted solutions found. Will implement custom.
*   **SvelteKit Authentication UI:** No direct, widely adopted solutions found. Will implement custom.

## Phase 2: Implementation

**Objective:** To implement the solutions to address all the findings from the review.

### 2.1. Address Critical Vulnerabilities (ARF-001, ARF-002, ARF-003)

*   **Objective:** Implement a secure password recovery flow and fix the route protection vulnerability.
*   **Implementation:**
    1.  **Fix Route Protection:** In `my-app/src/hooks.server.js`, remove `/auth/update-password` from the `unauthenticatedPaths` array.
    2.  **Refactor Existing Page:** Rename the route `my-app/src/routes/auth/update-password` to `my-app/src/routes/auth/change-password`.
    3.  **Implement Forgot Password Page:**
        *   Create a new route: `my-app/src/routes/auth/forgot-password`.
        *   Create a `+page.svelte` file with a form to enter an email address.
        *   Create a `+page.server.js` file to call `supabase.auth.resetPasswordForEmail()`.
    4.  **Implement Reset Password Page:**
        *   Create a new route: `my-app/src/routes/auth/reset-password`.
        *   Create a `+page.svelte` file with a form to enter and confirm the new password.
        *   This page will handle the password reset token from the URL and call `supabase.auth.updateUser()` to update the password.

### 2.2. Improve User Experience (ARF-004, ARF-005)

*   **Objective:** Enhance the usability of the signup and login pages.
*   **Implementation:**
    1.  **Password Strength Indicator:** In `my-app/src/routes/signup/+page.svelte`, implement a password strength indicator. This can be a custom component or a third-party library found during the research phase.
    2.  **Login Feedback:** In `my-app/src/routes/login/+page.svelte`, add a success message that is displayed after a successful login before the user is redirected.

## Phase 3: End-to-End Testing

**Objective:** To thoroughly test the implemented solutions to ensure they are working correctly and are secure.

**Critique of this Approach:** End-to-end tests are essential for critical flows but can be slow. This should be complemented with unit and integration tests in a mature development environment.

**Actions:**

1.  **Discover Tools:** Use `RUBE_SEARCH_TOOLS` with the `playwright` toolkit to find the necessary tools for web page testing.
    *   `RUBE_SEARCH_TOOLS(use_case="test a web page with playwright")`
2.  **Create Test Plan:** Create a `Auth_Test_Plan.md` file detailing the test cases.
3.  **Implement Test Cases:** Use the discovered `playwright` tools to implement the following test cases:
    *   **Signup:**
        *   Test successful signup.
        *   Test signup with an existing email.
        *   Test signup with a weak password.
    *   **Login:**
        *   Test successful login.
        *   Test login with incorrect credentials.
    *   **Password Recovery:**
        *   Test the "forgot password" email sending functionality.
        *   Test resetting the password with a valid token.
        *   Test resetting the password with an invalid or expired token.
    *   **Route Protection:**
        *   Test that unauthenticated users are redirected from protected routes.
        *   Test that authenticated users are redirected from the login and signup pages.
        *   Test that the `change-password` page is not accessible to unauthenticated users.
4.  **Execute Tests and Document Results:** Run all the tests and document the results. If any tests fail, create new findings and repeat the remediation process.
