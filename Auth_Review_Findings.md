## ARF-001: Missing Password Recovery Functionality

- **Component:** Password Recovery
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Description:** The "forgot password" functionality is completely missing from the application. There is no page or API route for users to reset their passwords if they forget them. This is a critical feature for any application with user accounts.
- **Evidence:** The directory `d:\DevProjects\LCC_Mgmt\my-app\src\routes` does not contain a `forgot-password` route. The `d:\DevProjects\LCC_Mgmt\my-app\src\routes\auth` directory also does not contain any related files.

## ARF-002: Incorrect Implementation of Update Password Page

- **Component:** Password Recovery
- **Severity:** High
- **Description:** The `update-password` page appears to be designed for a logged-in user to change their password, not for a user who has forgotten their password. The page does not handle any password reset token, which is a critical part of the password recovery flow. This means that even if a "forgot password" link was sent to the user, there is no mechanism to securely update the password.
- **Evidence:** The code in `my-app/src/routes/auth/update-password/+page.svelte` calls `supabase.auth.updateUser({ password })` without any token exchange. This function is for updating the password of the currently authenticated user.

## ARF-003: Critical Security Vulnerability in Route Protection

- **Component:** Session Management
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Description:** The `update-password` page is incorrectly marked as an unauthenticated path in `src/hooks.server.js`. This allows any unauthenticated user to access the page, which is a major security vulnerability. The `update-password` page should only be accessible to authenticated users.
- **Evidence:** The `unauthenticatedPaths` array in `my-app/src/hooks.server.js` contains `/auth/update-password`.
