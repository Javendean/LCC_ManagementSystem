# Authentication System Remediation Plan

This document outlines the plan to address the security vulnerabilities, bugs, and usability issues identified in the `Auth_Review_Findings.md` file.

## 1. Address Critical Vulnerabilities

### 1.1. ARF-003: Critical Security Vulnerability in Route Protection

*   **Objective:** Prevent unauthenticated access to the password update page.
*   **Action:** Modify the route protection logic in `my-app/src/hooks.server.js`.
*   **Implementation:**
    1.  Remove `/auth/update-password` from the `unauthenticatedPaths` array.

### 1.2. ARF-001 & ARF-002: Missing Password Recovery and Incorrect Implementation

*   **Objective:** Implement a secure and functional password recovery flow.
*   **Action:** Create a new, dedicated password recovery feature and refactor the existing update password page.
*   **Implementation:**

    **Phase 1: Refactor Existing Update Password Page**
    1.  Rename the route `my-app/src/routes/auth/update-password` to `my-app/src/routes/auth/change-password`. This page will be for authenticated users who want to change their password.

    **Phase 2: Implement New Forgot Password Flow**
    1.  Create a new route: `my-app/src/routes/auth/forgot-password`.
    2.  In this new directory, create a `+page.svelte` file containing a form for the user to enter their email address.
    3.  Create a corresponding `+page.server.js` file to handle the form submission. This server-side code will call the `supabase.auth.resetPasswordForEmail()` method.

    **Phase 3: Implement New Password Reset Page**
    1.  Supabase will send an email with a password reset link. This link will contain a token and will redirect the user back to the application. We need a new page to handle this.
    2.  Create a new route: `my-app/src/routes/auth/reset-password`.
    3.  Create a `+page.svelte` file with a form for the user to enter and confirm their new password.
    4.  The page will need to extract the access token from the URL hash fragment on the client-side. This is because the token is part of the URL fragment (`#`) and is not accessible on the server.
    5.  Upon form submission, the new password will be sent to a server-side endpoint. This endpoint will use the user's access token to update the user's password using `supabase.auth.updateUser()`.

## 2. Improve User Experience

### 2.1. ARF-004: Lack of Password Strength Feedback

*   **Objective:** Provide users with feedback on their password strength during signup.
*   **Action:** Add a password strength indicator to the signup page.
*   **Implementation:**
    1.  In `my-app/src/routes/signup/+page.svelte`, add a JavaScript function to evaluate the password strength based on criteria such as length, and the presence of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
    2.  Display a visual indicator (e.g., a colored bar and text) to provide real-time feedback to the user.

### 2.2. ARF-005: No Visual Feedback on Successful Login

*   **Objective:** Improve the user experience during the login process.
*   **Action:** Add a success message on the login page before redirecting.
*   **Implementation:**
    1.  In `my-app/src/routes/login/+page.svelte`, modify the `handleLogin` function to display a "Login successful, redirecting..." message after a successful login and before the `goto()` redirect is called.

This plan addresses all identified issues and follows the project's established conventions. The next step is to execute this plan.
